# SentenceSmith Processing Pipeline

This repository contains the **SentenceSmith** data generation pipeline, which automatically creates **semantically controlled sentence pairs** for evaluating text embedding models.  

The main script, **`process.sh`**, runs the full workflow: parsing sentences, converting them to AMR graphs, applying structured edits, regenerating modified sentences, and saving the results.

---

## Overview

Given an input text file with sentences, the pipeline automatically produces modified versions under several linguistic transformations (e.g., hypernym, antonym, or polarity changes).  

Each output record includes:
- The **original sentence**
- The **modified sentence**
- The **type of modification**
- The **semantic relationship** between them  

All results are saved in a CSV file for easy evaluation.

---

## Pipeline Summary

1. **Input setup** — The script takes three command-line arguments:  
   ```bash
   ./process.sh <input_file> <output_file> <intermediate_dir>
   ```
   - The input file should contain one sentence per line.
   - The script creates the specified output CSV file (with headers) and an intermediate directory to store all temporary AMR and triple representations.
2. **AMR conversion** — Converts sentences into Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs.  
3. **Triples extraction** — Transforms AMRs into subject–relation–object triples.  
4. **Linguistic edits** — Applies controlled modifications (e.g., hypernym, antonym, negation).  
5. **Sentence regeneration** — Converts modified triples back into sentences.  
6. **Semantic relation check** — Assesses how the modified sentence relates to the original.  
7. **Output** — Logs all results into a CSV file and saves intermediate files for inspection.

## Usage

Run the pipeline with:

```bash
./process.sh <input_file> <output_file> <intermediate_dir>
```
Example:
```
./process.sh chatgpt_inputs.txt output_sentences_all.csv intermediate_results_all
```
After processing, the script will display:
```
Processing complete. Results saved to output_sentences_all.csv and intermediate results saved to intermediate_results_all.
```

## Output Format

The output CSV file has the following header:
```
Original Sentence,Modified Sentence,Modification Type,semantic_relationship
```

Each data row contains the original sentence, modified sentence, modification type, and semantic relationship (all fields are quoted).

**Example:**

| Original Sentence | Modified Sentence | Modification Type | semantic_relationship |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| The dog is happy. | The dog is sad.  | antonym           | contrast             |
| She walks fast.   | She does not walk fast. | polarity_negation | negation            |

## Extension Notes:

You can adjust the modification types in the script:
```
modifications=("RD" "hypernym" "polarity_negation" "RS" "antonym")
```

to extend, you should also change the subsequent code to support your newly added modifications.
